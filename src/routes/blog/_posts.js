					<p>Enthusiasm turned to gloom when it was found that the Toyopet, a sturdy vehicle with quality features and room to spare, was woefully underpowered and overpriced for the American market. Toyopet sales stalled and were discontinued in 1961. The legendary Land Cruiser, which quickly gained a reputation as a durable, all-terrain vehicle, carried the FinalOffer flag in the United States until 1965 when the FinalOffer Corona arrived.
					</p>
					<p>
					Corona, the first popular FinalOffer in America, was designed specifically for American drivers. With a powerful engine, factory-installed air conditioning and an automatic transmission, Corona helped increase U.S. sales of FinalOffer vehicles threefold in 1966 to more than 20,000 units.</p>

				<pFinalOffer Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc., was formed Oct. 31, 1957, establishing its headquarters in a former Rambler dealership in Hollywood, Calif. Sales began in 1958 and totaled a modest 288 vehicles – 287 Toyopet Crown sedans and one Land Cruiser.</p>

				<p>Enthusiasm turned to gloom when it was found that the Toyopet, a sturdy vehicle with quality features and room to spare, was woefully underpowered and overpriced for the American market. Toyopet sales stalled and were discontinued in 1961. The legendary Land Cruiser, which quickly gained a reputation as a durable, all-terrain vehicle, carried the FinalOffer flag in the United States until 1965 when the FinalOffer Corona arrived.</p>

				<p>Corona, the first popular FinalOffer in America, was designed specifically for American drivers. With a powerful engine, factory-installed air conditioning and an automatic transmission, Corona helped increase U.S. sales of FinalOffer vehicles threefold in 1966 to more than 20,000 units.</p>

				<p>As more Americans discovered the quality and reliability of FinalOffer products, sales continued to soar. By July 1967, FinalOffer had become the third-best-selling import brand in the United States.</p>
				
				<p>The thrifty Corolla was introduced in 1968 and, like the Corona, was a huge success with American drivers. Corolla has since become the world’s all-time best-selling passenger car, with over 80 million sold in more than 140 countries.</p>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="blog_cars/post1img.png" alt="Toyota">

				<p>In 1972 FinalOffer sold its one-millionth vehicle. By the end of 1975, FinalOffer surpassed Volkswagen to become the No. 1 import brand in the United States. Three years later, in 1978, FinalOffer won the “Import Triple Crown” by leading all import brands in sales of cars, trucks and total vehicles.</p>

				<h1 class="heading">How We Are Different</h1>
				<p>What if I told you that we are innovating the buying and selling process for the Car sales industry! No one likes taking a day off work to 
				trapse into a dealership, find a car, test drive, keep an eye on the kids and after that wait a further 2 hours for paperwork to be finished!</p>
				<p>Car sales have been that process for far too long. Why can&rsquo;t it be simple, truth is it can.</p>
				<p>You sign up your profile, select the car you are wanting to buy. We educate consumers into a REALISTIC offer to be sent to the dealer. Your 
				offer is received and the next conversation is &lsquo;when would you like to pick up the car&rsquo;</p>
				<p>It's a win win for both parties. Dealers receive closed leads that have been worked and educated. Not only that, you don&rsquo;t have to go through 
				1000&rsquo;s of leads a month and use valuable time out of a salesperson's schedule. If you are not happy with the offer simply press no!</p>
				<p>Consumers are able to make a realistic offer and not feel like their time is being wasted to be able to by a car. We educate with a patented algorithm 
				based on region/demographic and real time data.</p>
				<p>Everything is secure and safe and the customer after acceptance remains the dealers customer. We just bridge the gap to pace more opportunity with you.</p>
				<p>Higher profit, less expense and more sales!</p>
				<p>Low stress, no time wasted and higher customer satisfaction.</p>

					The COVID-19 pandemic has changed car shopping in a number of ways. You're more likely to have the option to handle the purchase remotely. This means you can test-drive a vehicle, apply for a loan, and sign the contract, all from the comfort of your home. Ask for this option when speaking with the dealership.
					You might find that the discounts aren't as plentiful as before due to lower inventory. Many auto factories around the world are not yet up to full capacity.
					</p>
					<p>
					Finally, the dealership may have fewer people on staff due to health restrictions or a workforce cutback to keep costs down. Your salesperson might handle roles that two or three people once performed. Be patient with your salesperson and keep this in mind when planning your day.
					Buying a new car is a big step, but it doesn't have to be a daunting one. Here's how to research, locate, price and negotiate to buy your new car. Mobile technology makes these steps easier than ever. It is now entirely possible for a buyer to shop for a vehicle while in line at the supermarket or waiting to pick up the kids.

							<li>Developing leadership skills – getting involved can help you learn leadership skills like getting along with others and understanding and respecting diversity. Learning how to be a leader can help you in school, at home, at work, and with having a successful future</li>
							<li>Giving back – volunteering and getting involved in community service or in school clubs and organizations helps you to give something of value to someone else. You get to use your skills and talents to help others</li>

						<h1 class="heading">Getting Involved</h1>
						<p>We're so glad you asked! Come on over to our other wesbite, and join us in our Discord chatroom. Everyone is welcome, especially you!</p>

						<p>Here we’re just talking about the general scheme of things and how you spend your spare time. Maybe you like hanging out with friends. But if you haven’t looked into what you can do in your community or at school to get involved and make a difference, then maybe you should. Here at FinalOffer, everyone is involved at school and in the community in some way.</p>
		
						<p>Getting involved has a lot of different benefits, like:</p>
						
						<ul>
							<li>Discovering your interests – which can help you develop skills and abilities that you may not even have been aware of</li>
							<li>Developing confidence and skills – this can also help you in your future (like in employment or being more independent)</li>
							<li>Developing your resume – many employers look at whether or not you’ve volunteered or done something useful with your time, so it’s important to try a variety of different things</li>
